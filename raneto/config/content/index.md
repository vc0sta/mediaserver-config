This is the knowledgebase to configure your own mediaserver.

The current scripts and service are currently running in a Raspberry Pi 4, but everything should work on any other hardware with container capabilities.

## Overview
The Mediaserver project started with the objective of creating a self-hosted media solution with automated downloads for movies and series via torrent. But as it evolved, the scope became bigger and bigger, and now it is running all of my self hosted services.

### Hardware Specifications

The server itself has nothing special regarding hardware:

- RaspberryPi 4
- 7TB external Harddrive
    - mounted in '/mnt/storage'
